# A development process for an end-to-end NLP text summarization model:

## Background:
Text summarization is a challenging task that involves generating a concise and coherent summary of a long text. End-to-end text summarization models aim to automatically generate summaries that capture the main points of the original text while being as concise as possible.

## Objective:
The objective of this project is to develop an end-to-end NLP text summarization model that can generate high-quality summaries of long texts.

## Dataset:
The dataset used for this project is the CNN/Daily Mail dataset, which consists of news articles from CNN and the Daily Mail. The dataset includes over 280,000 articles, each with a corresponding summary.

## Explanation of how your model works:
The model used in this project is an extractive summarization model that uses a sequence-to-sequence architecture with attention. The model takes the input text and encodes it into a fixed-length vector representation using an encoder. The decoder then takes this vector representation and generates the summary. The attention mechanism allows the model to focus on different parts of the input text when generating each word in the summary.

## Algorithm implementation and hyperparameter experimentation to improve model performance accordingly:
The model was implemented using the PyTorch deep learning framework. The hyperparameters were optimized using a combination of manual tuning and automated hyperparameter optimization techniques. The model was trained using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001. The batch size was set to 64, and the model was trained for 10 epochs. The model's performance was evaluated using the ROUGE metric, which measures the overlap between the generated summary and the reference summary.

## Future Works:
Future work could involve exploring other types of summarization models, such as abstractive summarization models, and experimenting with different types of attention mechanisms. Additionally, the model could be fine-tuned on other types of text, such as scientific articles or legal documents.
